# About Me
Hi there! My name is Jorge. 

I'm a software engineer with 8+ years of professional experience, specialized in frontend development. 
In my freetime you can find me tinkering with gaming and machine learning, botting, game development, IT security, 
blockchain technology, software-defined radio, raspberry pi and linux, and pondering my ever growing list of startup ideas.

Outside of tech, I enjoy swimming, biking, playing board games, and fiddling with a good puzzle or two.
