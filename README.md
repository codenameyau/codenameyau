# About Me
Nice to meet you. My name is Jorge. I'm from NYC.

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of professional software engineering experience. 

In my freetime you can find me tinkering with bots, game development, generative AI, procedural generation, IT security,
software-defined radio, raspberry pi, ardunio, and grooming my ever growing list of startup ideas.

Outside of tech, I enjoy swimming, biking, eating out, hiking, and immersing in nature. 
When I'm not outside you can find me fiddling with rubik's cubes, playing Civ6, and countless other board games.
