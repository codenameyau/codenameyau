# About Me
Nice to meet you! My name is Jorge. I'm from NYC.

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of professional software engineering experience and 3+ year of engineering management experience. 

In my freetime you can find me tinkering with bots, game development, generative AI, procedural generation, 
IT security, software-defined radio, raspberry pi, and grooming my ever growing list of startup ideas.

Outside of tech, I enjoy swimming, biking, eating out, hiking, and immersing in nature.
When I'm not outside you can find me fiddling with 3D puzzles, collecting coins and comic books, and creating my own board games.
